 It's an anthology series where each story focuses on a different member of a group that operates in the shadows. There’s always the question lingering: are they truly heroes, or do the rumors about them hold some truth? Either way, they’re fighting against something far darker, tied to the powers people rely on and the secrets behind them.
 
 Titan, Priest, Reaper, Zero, Zephyr, Leviathan, and Volt
 
 Subject: Leviathan Status: Former Academy Candidate Background: Leviathan was born to a single mother of limited means who worked at a local bakery. Despite financial hardships, her mother was known for her kindness and dedication to the community, often caring for other orphans in the area, who became Leviathan’s close companions. Leviathan’s father abandoned the family prior to her birth, but her mother refrained from speaking negatively about him. In this society, individuals of appropriate age may inherit the will of the Goddess, manifested in elemental forms. Those demonstrating compatibility are sent to the academy for formal training, a path that brings honor and financial security to their families. Leviathan showed great enthusiasm for this opportunity, anticipating a brighter future. Incident Report: The turning point in Leviathan’s life occurred when her mother was killed in her presence. Following this event, records indicate that Leviathan invoked the powers of The Blight, a force diametrically opposed to the will of the Goddess. This act culminated in the destruction of all those identified as her betrayers.
 
 
 The Genesis Initiative operates in secrecy, manipulating genetics and controlling every aspect of human development to produce individuals with unparalleled abilities. They recruit or abduct promising candidates to serve as "genetic donors," combining DNA from individuals with exceptional traits. The resulting “Agents” are enhanced through advanced genetic editing, rigorous training, and harsh conditioning. These children are raised in controlled environments, stripped of traditional emotional connections, and molded into loyal, powerful soldiers. Every child must surpass their predecessor in physical, mental, and combat capabilities, because of this many children are killed in the process of creating a perfected Agent The Initiative ensures loyalty through psychological conditioning, protocols, and a Watcher program. Where proved loyalist and recuited to care for incoming candidates. Begins at birth with neural conditioning to enhance cognitive and reflexive abilities. By age 5, subjects undergo combat training and genetic performance assessments. Enhancement surgeries and augmentations are performed as early as age 10. Only the strongest candidates are permitted to continue; the rest are "recycled" into the program's research divisions.
 
 Zero was the first subject of a new project developed by the Initiative, designated as Test Subject 0. The program aimed to create the ultimate soldier, one capable of not only combating The Blight but also standing against those empowered by the Goddess’s Will. In total, 52 children were part of the experiment. Of those, 34 died before the age of three due to complications from the modifications. The remaining subjects endured grueling combat training, but their bodies eventually succumbed to slow, systemic poisoning caused by the experimental procedures. Out of the survivors, 13 were deemed stable enough to be transferred to the Agent program, the Initiative's elite division. Zero, however, was an anomaly. While most subjects perished quickly, he survived, albeit in stasis. Kept in a test tube for years, Zero was observed closely as the scientists attempted to understand why he hadn’t failed like the others. When it became clear that he would not die, he was finally released and transferred to the Agent program. During his time in the program, Zero formed close bonds with other agents, something unexpected and unprecedented for subjects of the Initiative. These friendships became the foundation of his growing dissent. Through their collective efforts, Zero orchestrated a revolt that culminated in the death of the scientists and the complete annihilation of the Initiative’s leadership.
 
 
 Agents are highly trained and enhanced operatives who serve as tools for the ruling class. In a world of constant political and military conflict, with over 40 countries under the overarching influence of the Church of Solace, these agents are commodities traded and employed by the highest bidder. Their abilities make them indispensable in maintaining power, waging covert operations, or enforcing the will of those who control them. From Espionage, Assassination, to Personal Protection they used, caring little for their humanity, viewing them as disposable assets
 
 
 Many of the children who survived the uprising made different choices about their futures. Some stayed together at the former site of the Initiative, while others left to explore the world they had been hidden from for so long. Zero, along with several others, remained at the location for quite some time, driven by a shared vision of rebuilding what had been destroyed but with a new purpose. Together, they formed a reimagined version of the Initiative, naming it Renewal Initiative, or as many come to refer it The Midnight Society. Unlike before, they sought not to exploit or harm others but to create a world where they and others like them could feel safe. It became a sanctuary for those who had nowhere else to turn, a place for outcasts, survivors, and those abandoned by society. Zero and his friends worked tirelessly to ensure that no one else would endure the horrors they had faced. They reached out to others across the fractured nations, offering a home and a purpose to those in need. Though not all of the survivors remained close, many of them maintained their bonds, finding comfort in the rare understanding only they could share.
 
 
 Subject: Volt Country of Origin: Thresa Background: Volt was born as the fifth son of the Marquess of Thresa. Raised in privilege, Volt lived a spoiled and carefree life, unburdened by the responsibilities of his noble lineage. However, as he came of age, he began to rebel against the expectations placed upon him. From an early age, Volt displayed an extraordinary aptitude for lightning magic. His unique abilities allowed him to channel electricity through his body, granting him incredible speed and agility. Volt often boasted about such speed. This combination of arrogance and skill earned him a reputation among his peers as both a braggart and a prodigy. Volt used his abilities to steal from local viscounts and barons, redistributing their wealth to the impoverished citizens of the region. These actions, though illegal, garnered admiration from the common people and disdain from his family. Despite their disapproval, Volt reveled in his dual reputation as a noble misfit and a hero of the downtrodden. Incident Report: While exploring the outskirts of his family’s lands, Volt discovered an abandoned church. However, this was not one of the Churches of Solace. Within its ruins, he uncovered a child-smuggling operation orchestrated by the Cult of Chaos, a group dedicated to serving The Blight. The cult sought to corrupt and subjugate the world under its influence, using the children as tools for their twisted cause. Volt’s investigation revealed that the local viscount was actively supporting the cult, funding and protecting their operations. This betrayal of trust enraged Volt, and he resolved to take justice into his own hands. Using his lightning-infused speed and precision, Volt confronted the viscount, delivering a swift and decisive death. This act marked a turning point in Volt’s life, due to the cults secrecy it could never be proven he was collaborating and Volt was outcasted for murder.
 
 
 The Blight is a simplification of something far more profound. In the beginning, there was only nothingness, an infinite void of silence and stillness. From this emptiness, the Goddess emerged and created everything, shaping light, life, and matter into existence. Yet, in doing so, she disturbed the void, leaving behind a lingering will of the nothingness she had drawn from. The Blight is that will, an entity that seeks to reclaim what was taken, to unmake all creation, and to return everything to the void from which it came. It is not simply a force of corruption but the embodiment of entropy, existing to oppose the order and purpose brought into the world by the Goddess
  Just as the Goddess has her bishops to spread her light, the Blight manifests its will through chosen vessels. These individuals, often consumed rather than selected, serve as agents of destruction, spreading chaos and decay wherever they go. The Blight affects not only the physical world but also the minds and hearts of those it touches, feeding on fear and despair. It is an ever-present force, eroding creation and waging an eternal struggle against the Goddess. While the Goddess offers hope and creation, the Blight represents the emptiness’s inexorable desire to take it all back.
  
  
  The Blight often grants immense power to those who heed its call, whether through promises of strength or through manipulation. This power is not inherently incompatible with the Goddess’s will; instead, it amplifies them in unnatural and dangerous ways. The Blight feeds on ambition and desperation, causing its recipients’ abilities to grow rapidly, sometimes to extraordinary levels. However, this growth comes at a cost. As the power increases, so does its corrupting influence. The Blight clouds the mind and distorts judgment, driving those it touches to insatiable hunger for more strength or control. This insidious effect not only consumes the individual but also spreads chaos and destruction to those around them. The more they use the Blight’s power, the further they fall from reason.
