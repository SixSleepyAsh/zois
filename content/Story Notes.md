Shadow Beast incident


### **Background**

- **Early Life:**  
    Born to a family of royal artisans, Thorne was expected to carve masks for the nobility. But he secretly trained with the guards, his antlers thickening with each clandestine sparring session. At 30, he single-handedly halted an assassination attempt on the young King Chrysós, earning his captaincy—and his scar.

- **The Crack:**  
    The fracture in his face occurred during the Battle of Shifting Canopies, where he shielded the king from a shadowbeast’s talons. The sap that seals it is harvested from the Heart Tree, a sacred relic, binding him symbolically to the kingdom’s life force.

- **Role in the Royal Guard:**  
    Thorne redesigned the guard’s training regimen, emphasizing adaptability over brute strength. His *Roots and Branches* tactic—using the forest itself as a weapon—has repelled countless invasions.

- **Relationship with the Chrysós Family:**  
    He views Talos as a sapling struggling to grow in shadow. Though he outwardly upholds the king’s harsh standards, he privately leaves scrolls on unconventional combat strategies in the prince’s quarters.
## General Setting

Current Day Zoís Kingdom 

A bright and colorful plant kingdom; in a forest filled with trees that are so large that they line the canopy with crisp green leaves. The carriages are drawn by golden steeds lined with purple and pink flowers. A long flag is seen on poles at every block. The flag shines as it shows the symbol of the royal family; two deer with a spear separating the two.

## Story Movements Not final draft

Chapter One: Life’s Dew
In the past there existed a single kingdom of Zoís; with it came the three great guardian beings. Fytó the Deer guardian of the Forest and Ruler of life itself. Fthorá the Rhinoceros beetle of the outer woods and Ruler of all that Dies. The Guardian of the Sand, Chtízo, the Ruler of The Earth. Aéras (Giant Eagle) the Guardian of the Mountains and the Ruler of the Skies.

-CRACK- -CRACK- 

The sounds of the training staves of the young soldiers of the Zoís kingdom striking against one another, on the training grounds, including the prince. “He-Hey wait wait-” -BAM- said Prince Talos right before one of the young soldiers hit him right in the chest making him fall right on his back coughing and wheezing. All of the soldiers laugh as the prince rolls over to his side. “Look at him, haha”.

“Isn't he supposed to be the crown prince haha.” Prince Talos gets up and runs away towards the main tower with the words of the soldiers trailing after him. This isn’t the first time he has heard these words pointed at him like a sharp knife, but with the crowning ceremony arriving so soon he had no choice but to face his thoughts of being qualified enough to even be in this kingdom. “Someone alert King Chrysós! The crown prince has disappeared!” yells a royal guard. The captain of the guard storms into the large bedroom; the room covered top to bottom in vines and plant life. The Crown Prince’s bed, which looked as if it was carved out of a giant tree, was empty of the owner.
    
"How could this happen?” says the captain. The rest of the guards who had gathered muttered and whispered. The look on the captain’s face grew more irritated and redder as he yelled “Speak now or you are all being taken to the outer woods!” The guard who was first in the room speaks up. “He asked to train in the courtyard for his spear lessons tomorrow. He then asked us to go because he would just head to his room on his own, and since the prince is well y’know-” the captain interrupted. “Since the prince is weak you thought nothing?” , “We need to find the crown prince before tomorrow or King Chrysós won’t allow me to rest my head on my shoulders.” The howling winds of the forest wisp by Talos’s head as he runs through the forest. He prays but no t with his words, not with his mind, and not even with his heart. He prays with his soul, the very meaning of his being to Fytó. He prays for a way for him to change. A way for him to become the king that everyone in the kingdom doesn’t think that he can be. The wet leaves of the plants hitting his forehead wiping away the tears off his face. The fears, the hatred, and all the emotions pushed onto him from his family and the kingdom; being washed away by the winds of the inner forest. The moon glaring over the canopy of the forest, shining down onto the forest floor illuminating the bizarre wildlife of the inner forest. Talos stops and looks around unsure as to where he is, but he didn’t care, all he wanted was to leave.
    
A sound rustles the leaves a little far off in the forest. Talos looks around carefully and walks backwards until his back the moist bark off the tree cooling his body down from the run. “Is there- Is there anyone there?” He spoke into the darkness expecting a response but only silence returned. He slid his back down the tree and rested his head on his knees on the ground. He cried thinking about how powerless he was, and how even his own subjects of his kingdom see him as nothing. “Do you seek power child of mine?” said a deep calming voice from the forest forcing Talos to look up. “Who’s the-there.” he said nervously “Do you seek power?” The voice repeated, Talos’s mind went in a loop about who this voice could possibly be, but something inside of him sprouted in this moment. “Yes” “I seek power, I want to become stronger and someone that isn’t laughed at.” What looks to be a giant deer steps forth from the trees, surprising Talos, walks closer, its antlers glowing brighter and brighter. “Then power you shall have, My Child, You shall grow strong. Strong enough not to erase the shadows of doubt of others, but enough to protect those without the power to fight back those shadows.” The Deer walks up to Talos and touches his antler to his head.
