**Race Name:** Zolris

**Description:**
The Zolris are an enigmatic race with faces resembling intricately carved wooden masks, their features evoking the beauty and mystery of a living forest. Their glowing, circular eyes radiate an otherworldly charm, and the number and placement of these luminous eyes vary from individual to individual. The masks themselves feature unique, natural patterns, mimicking the textures of bark or the veins of leaves.

Crowning their heads are antler-like protrusions, which enhance their mystical and regal presence. From behind these masks extend vibrant, feather-like gills that fan out elegantly. These feathers, alive with color, possess a remarkable ability to shift hues based on the Zolris' emotional state. While each individual has a signature color palette that defines their identity, their emotions subtly alter the tone or intensity of these hues. This dynamic display adds a ceremonial and almost hypnotic quality to their appearance. Additionally, they can camouflage by adapting their feather colors to blend seamlessly with their environment, a natural defense mechanism honed over centuries.

The Zolris' physical form is both graceful and sturdy. They possess three long, dexterous fingers and a thumb on each hand, ideal for crafting and delicate movements. Their feet feature three toes covered in a thick layer of fuzzy felt-like padding, granting them silent and surefooted movement through any terrain. True to their connection with nature, they do not wear shoes, allowing them to stay attuned to the earth beneath them.

The Zolris as a whole embody a deep connection to their environment, exuding an air of natural harmony, mysticism, and adaptability. Every aspect of their being reflects their role as guardians or dwellers of a magical, forested world.
