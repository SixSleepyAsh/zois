## Page 1

**Panel 1**  
*Wide shot of the academy courtyard. Stone slabs gleam under the midday sun, training equipment visible along the walls. Talos and Valhn are mid-combat, wooden staves clashing. Talos’s green-and-gold gills flare in agitation.*

**SFX:**  
CRACK! CRACK!

**TALOS (shouting):**  
He—hey, wait—

**Panel 2**  
*Close-up of Valhn, his mask glowing faintly under intricate bark-like designs. His stave strikes Talos hard in the chest.*

**SFX:**  
THWACK!

**Panel 3**  
*Talos sprawls on the stone, gasping, his glowing eyes flickering. His gills fade to muted shades of green. A group of students laugh cruelly in the background.*

**SFX:**  
HAHAHA!

**DIALOGUE (background students):**  
“Look at him! The *prince*! Hahaha!”  
“Isn’t he supposed to lead us one day?”

**Panel 1**  
*Medium shot of Talos, clutching his chest as he struggles to sit up. His hands press against the rough stone for support.*

**DIALOGUE (background students):**  
“At this rate, Valhn will ascend instead.”  
“Talos should stick to books.”

**Panel 2**  
*Close-up of Valhn stepping forward. His feathers flare crimson, his stance confident.*

**VALHN:**  
"You’ve been stuck in the same place for ages, Talos. Maybe try gardening. At least you wouldn’t embarrass yourself there."

**Panel 3**  
*Focus on Talos, his glowing eyes narrowing. His feathers shift to a stormy ochre as his fists tighten.*

**TALOS (thinking):**  
The succession ceremony is so close...I can’t fail.

**Panel 4**  
*Wide shot of the courtyard. Talos stands, his battered body defiant as he stares past Valhn toward the academy spires and horizon.*

**TALOS (thinking):**  
I refuse to yield.

## Page 3

**Panel 1**  
*Interior shot of Talos’s quarters. The room is modest, with shelves of worn scrolls and a training stave leaning by the door. Talos enters, the glow of his mask dimming.*

**SFX:**  
*rustle*

**Panel 2**  
*Close-up of Talos’s hands as he removes his training gear, revealing the natural wood patterns of his mask beneath.*

**Panel 3**  
*Medium shot of the amber pendant on its stand, softly glowing. Talos’s hand hovers near it.*

**Panel 4**  
*Close-up of Talos, eyes closed, holding the pendant. His feathers shift to a calm, golden hue.*

**TALOS (whispering):**  
Mother...I’ll find my strength.
