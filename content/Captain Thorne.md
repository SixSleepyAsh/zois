### **Appearance**

Thorne’s visage is a living chronicle of service. His, carved from patterns mimicking ancient oak bark, bears a diagonal crack that splits from his left temple to the right edge of his lower face—a relic from a skirmish defending King Chrysós. The crack, filled with faintly luminescent sap, pulses imperceptibly during combat, as if the wound itself remembers its purpose.

His **four glowing green eyes**—arranged symmetrically above and below the horizontal axis of his face—burn with the vigilance of a seasoned sentinel. In moments of calm, they dim to soft jade embers, but in battle, they flare like wildfire, granting him unparalleled peripheral vision and the ability to track multiple threats simultaneously.

Crowning his head are antlers are streaked with veins of liquid silver, a rare mutation among Zolris symbolizing his decades of leadership. These antlers, thicker and more gnarled than those of younger kin, hum faintly when danger nears, attuned to the primal magic of Zoís’s forests.

From his sides, his gills cascades in deep emerald, threaded with silver streaks that shimmer like moonlight on leaves. Their hues shift subtly: calm and fluid during strategy sessions, bristling into sharp, metallic tones when he barks orders on the battlefield.

Thorne’s armor is a masterwork of Zoís craftsmanship. Forged from lightweight alloy, its silver-etched plates are inlaid with moss-green enamel, mimicking the dappled light of the forest canopy. The pauldrons taper into leaf-shaped spikes, functional yet elegant, and the chestplate bears the Chrysós crest etched in obsidian.

His hands, though armored, retain their natural Zolris dexterity. Three long fingers and a thumb, rest with lethal precision on the hilt of his spear, *Vigil’s Reach*.
