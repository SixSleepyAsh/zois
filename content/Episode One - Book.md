## Scene 1: The Academy Courtyard

**CRACK! CRACK!**  
The sharp clash of wooden staves echoed across the academy training grounds, bouncing off the smooth stone slabs and mingling with the rhythmic patter of feet against the circular stage. Prince Talos found himself once again on the defensive, his vibrant green-and-gold gills flaring behind him with agitation.  

“He—hey, wait—”  
**THWACK!**  

A well-aimed strike slammed into his chest, sending him sprawling onto the unforgiving stone. Talos gasped as the impact rattled his ribs, the glowing eyes of his mask flickering momentarily from the force. He lay there for a moment, clutching his felted chest as his breath came in painful rasps. Around him, cruel laughter erupted—a harsh chorus that stung far deeper than the blow itself.  

The training grounds, with their expansive stone flooring and towering walls lined with equipment containers, offered no comfort. Wooden staves rested neatly in racks near the walls, ready for use, while the open space beyond the circular stage hinted at endless morning laps run by weary students. But right now, the world felt smaller, collapsing into the circle of ridicule around him.  

Talos pressed a hand to the slabs beneath him, the rough texture grounding him as he struggled to sit up. His feathers now flickered in dull, muted shades of green. The voices of his peers struck like whips, their taunts sharper than any blade.  

> “Look at him! The *prince*! Hahaha!”  

> “Isn’t he supposed to lead us one day?”  

> “At this rate, Valhn will ascend instead. At least *he* doesn’t humiliate the throne.”  

> “Talos should stick to books. Maybe he can write a guide on how *not* to fight!”  

Talos shifted his weight and pushed himself upright, his gills quivering faintly as streaks of gold began to creep back into their hue. The words hurt more than the physical pain, and the thought of Valhn—the academy's prodigy—taking his **right** sent a bitter pang through his core.  

"You’ve been stuck in the same place for ages, Talos," Valhn sneered, stepping forward. His mask, adorned with intricate bark-like whorls, glinted under the midday light, and his feathers flared a triumphant crimson. "Maybe you should consider a career with the temple gardeners. At least you wouldn’t embarrass yourself there."  

Talos’s glowing eyes narrowed as his hands tightened into fists, claws flexing slightly. He knew Valhn’s words were meant to provoke him, but the insult still stung. His feathers betrayed his inner turmoil, the golden hues shifting to a stormy ochre as he struggled to steady himself.  

Beyond Valhn, the walls of the academy framed the training grounds, their smooth, spires towering high above. The open space hummed with the memory of morning drills, of laps run endlessly around the circular stage, but all Talos could think about was the looming succession ceremony. With it came the weight of expectations—expectations he was struggling to meet.  

Valhn stepped closer, his voice dropping to a venomous murmur. "You know, Talos, it’s not too late to back out. No one would blame you for admitting you’re not cut out for this. Tomorrow, we train with real spears—not sticks for sparring children. Maybe grab a broomstick instead. That’s more your speed."  

Talos’s gills flared, their colors darkening to an angry orange. His glowing eyes burned brighter, twin orbs of golden defiance against Valhn’s taunts. Though his body ached and his pride lay battered, something deep within him refused to yield. He straightened his stance, staring beyond Valhn to the spires and the horizon beyond.  

## Scene 2: Talos's Quarters 

The soft rustle of feathers filled the air as Talos entered his private quarters, the faint glow of his mask’s eyes dimming to a gentle ember. The familiar scent of parchment and ink enveloped him, a soothing balm against the day’s harsh trials. This room was his sanctuary—a haven where the crushing weight of expectations and the sting of ridicule could be set aside, if only for a fleeting moment. 

He moved with a quiet grace, his steps barely making a sound on the polished wooden floor. The straps of his training gear came loose under his practiced hands, the layered fibers of his chest plate sliding away to reveal the natural patterns etched into his wooden mask. The wooden stave, now nothing more than a symbol of his humiliation, leaned against the wall near the door. Its polished surface caught the dim light filtering through the narrow window, mocking him with its pristine sheen. 

Talos hesitated, his gaze drifting to the stand beside his desk. Hanging there was an amber pendant, suspended from a simple cord. The pendant glowed faintly in the muted light, its warmth radiating a quiet sense of reassurance. His fingers brushed the pendant gently, the familiar weight a reminder of his mother’s love and the wisdom she once shared. The room around him was modest yet filled with personal touches. 

Scrolls and tomes lined the shelves, their edges worn from years of study. A bundle of feathers in varying hues rested on a small table, a memento of past achievements and fleeting moments of joy. The faint hum of the pendant in his hand resonated with his heartbeat, grounding him as he closed his eyes and exhaled. Here, at least, he could breathe.
