3. **Xéros** - Desert God (Sand, Heat, Survival)

# The Cosmic Conflict

In the beginning, there was nothing. Éremos existed alone in perfect peace and silence. Then the other six gods emerged/arrived and shattered his tranquility with their creations - forests, oceans, mountains, deserts, sky, fire. Everything they made was noise and chaos to him.

**Éremos’s Goal:** Restore the primordial peace by unmaking all creation, returning everything to the void. He corrupts the other gods’ creations, trying to erase existence itself.  

**The Gods’ Response:** Each god created a reincarnated disciple - mortals who carry divine power and can anchor their patron’s domain in the physical world.
